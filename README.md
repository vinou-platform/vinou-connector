### What is Vinou?

Vinou is an ecosystem of applications based on the Vinou Platform. The main application is Vinou-Office that is nearly an ERP-SaaS-System for winemakers and winetraders. The goal is to automate all processes along the production and supply chain by using platform technology. We want to ensure that winemakers and winetraders can use the Vinou ecosystem as their personal tool belt in production and marketing. And this extension is a small application to transfer wine data from production to consumer automated and directly in realtime without the need of any synchronisation.

### Short Installation

**Please note that we currently starting Open-Source support of our extension. We try to continue completion of documentation**

####1. Install Extension

To install the extension composer is recommended

```composer require vinou/vinou-connector```

####2. Setup connection to Vinou-Platform

To connect your TYPO3 installation with your Vinou-Office log into your Vinou-Office (https://app.vinou.de) choose "connections" and create a new manual connection. This connection provides your "Token".

Next step is to fetch your AuthId from your account data. Therefore switch to settings an open account/invoice information.

At Least fill in this token and AuthId in the Extension configuration within the TYPO3-Extension-Manager

Now you're done and can start integration. Good luck and have fun.
